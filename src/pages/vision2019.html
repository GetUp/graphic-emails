      More than 92% of GetUp members want to target hard right MPs who block progress on the issues we care about.

        This is just the beginning. Over the next couple of months, GetUp's strategy team will gather more member feedback, talk to voters, and use these survey results to draw up GetUp's most impactful election strategy to date.
