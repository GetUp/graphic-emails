      <h1>{Name|Friend}, you've made the news.</h1>

      <p>
        The Morrison Government is desperately scrambling to shut down dissent and avoid
        accountability, but they cannot stop us. We've just covered the capital with an
        unequivocal call for press freedom ‚Äì and an exciting invitation next week shows
        momentum is growing.
      </p>

      <p>
        And is it any surprise?
      </p>

      <p>
        The backlash against the AFP's raids of journalists' homes and offices was rare,
        unifying, and severe. As the Morrison Government made excuses for the obscene
        overreach, a whopping 75% of Australians believed something was seriously wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="big-heading">
        And so you acted:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Over 100,000 of us joined the call for a Media Freedom Act ‚Äì and we took those
          voices straight to Parliament.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over 5,000 of you funded a report into the dire state of Australian press
          freedom, exposing attacks on journalists, whistleblowers, and our ABC.
        </li>
        <li>
          Almost 2,500 of you made submissions to the Senate Inquiry ‚Äì farmers, veterans,
          Liberal voters, and history teachers stood together to call for press freedom.
        </li>
        <li>
          We covered capital cities in posters, light-projections, chalk stencils,
          billboards and digital ads to remind politicians of just what was at stake.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="footer">
        And it all came together at an event in the halls of Parliament in late September,
        where GetUp members joined former Senator Scott Ludlam, Independent MP Andrew
        Wilkie and Greens Senator Sarah Hanson Young to handover the petition and launch
        the BREAKING Report ‚Äì generating a media storm.

        Against his wishes, we're cutting through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next Wednesday, on October 16th, GetUp National Director Paul Oosting has been
        invited to deliver a major address to the National Press Club. (If you aren't in
        Canberra, you can watch along live on ABC News 24 from 12pm.)
      </p>
      <p>
        As our movement faces smears from cynical, out-of-touch politicians and a
        for-profit press desperate to repeat The Government's lines to sell newspapers ‚Äì
        we have a chance to correct the record.
      </p>
      <p>
        The message is simple:
      </p>
      <p>
        As armed police raid journalists, whistleblowers face appalling prison sentences
        and the Government stifles the right to protest, it has never been so important
        for ordinary people to stand together and take action.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, in such a climate, getting a message out there at all is no mean feat.
        But thanks to our power together, we're centre stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        See you at the Press Club,
        <br />
        Patrick, Sarah and Tosca ‚Äì for the GetUp team ‚ù§Ô∏è P.S.

      <p>
        Niren ‚Äì if this is work you're proud of and you have the means, please think about
        making a regular contribution to keep this movement going. $8 a month means we can
        always keep up the fight. Like Netflix... for justice üòâ
