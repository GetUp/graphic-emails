      <p><b>Our movement has just secured a massive win.</b></p>
      <p>
        The bill once referred to as the ‘advocacy gag law’ quietly passed earlier this week. Why so quiet? Because thanks to almost a year of tireless campaigning from GetUp members like you, the Coalition was forced to rewrite it <i>completely</i>. <b>It will no longer hurt our people-powered movement or civil society more broadly.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, that bill was just one of many attacks the Hard Right directed at our movement this year. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>But GetUp members have stood strong at every turn, and almost 20,000 incredible people chipped in to fend off these attacks. </b>As the Hard Right’s toxic agenda continues to rip their own party apart, our people-powered movement has only grown stronger. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, we’ve sent a message that cannot be ignored: any Government that tries to silence the people who elected it will be met with fierce resistance – and forced to pay the price.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s take a look back at what we’ve achieved together…

      <h1 class="section-heading">Putting an end to the ‘Advocacy Gag Law’</h1>
      <p>
        The Coalition’s original advocacy gag law was a full scale assault by the Hard Right on GetUp, the charity sector, and civil society at large. It would have choked off our people-powered fundraising, and forced us to give up our political independence.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>But GetUp members stepped up and fought back like never before.</b> Together with our friends in civil society, especially the Hands Off Our Charities Alliance we left the Coalition with no choice but to amend the bill to within an inch of its life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        How did we do it? Together we launched the biggest campaign blitz in our history with over 40,000 phone calls, emails, letters-to-the-editor, Facebook posts, tweets, in-person visits, postal letters and even good old faxes.
      </p>
      <img alt="9593 emails; 9511 letters; 7560 faxes; 2281 calls straight to MP" src="http://cdn.getup.org.au/image_19549_full.jpg">
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <p>
        We made sure the voices of everyday people were front and centre everywhere our politicians looked.

        We’ve shown once again that when we all come together, our movement is more powerful than anything the Hard Right can throw at us.

      <h1 class="section-heading">Powering Our Civil Defence Fund</h1>
      <p>
        The Hard Right’s relentless attacks have meant GetUp needs the best legal firepower available to us. Thanks to the thousands of GetUp members who make contributions to our Civil Defence Fund, we’ve been able to weather the storm and concentrate on keeping our crucial campaigns on track.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hard Right launched their third attempt to have the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) force GetUp members to become an ‘associated entity’ of other political parties.<sup>2</sup> <b>The ongoing investigation has been exhausting, but thanks to everyone who chipped into our Civil Defence Fund, it hasn’t dragged precious resources away from the fight for the issues we care about. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The people who power our Civil Defence Fund also made it possible for us to obtain the best legal advice available to ascertain how the Coalition’s draconian new ‘national security’ laws would affect our campaigns.<sup>3</sup> This ongoing advice has been crucial in allowing us to continue fearlessly campaigning for a fair, flourishing and just future. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Most recently, this people-powered funding paid for crucial legal advice that allowed us to shine a light on the medical emergency for children detained in Australia's cruel offshore detention regime on Nauru. <b>Because of that, 107 kids like George* and their families have now been brought to safety in Australia. </b>

      <h1 class="section-heading">Of course, the fight doesn’t end here… </h1>
      <p>
        <b>Already this week, Hard Right MP Ben Morton has threatened to drag our people-powered movement through yet another parliamentary inquiry</b> — accusing our movement of being in ‘contempt of Parliament’ and ignoring GetUp members’ views in developing our 2016 election strategy.<sup>4</sup> It’s a concocted attempt by a desperate government trying to distract from its own political implosion.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not the first time that powerful enemies have used dirty tricks to try to silence our voices and curb our ability to campaign.<b> But, staying true to form, GetUp members won’t stand down.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re hitting back with our proud and defiant <i>Statement of Independence</i> – which thousands of members chipped in to publish as a full page ad in the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, and the nationwide Saturday Paper.

        Against the backdrop of chaos that’s defining Australian politics at the moment, one thing is crystal clear: our movement is under attack because the Hard right is scared of you, {NAME|Friend}. They’re terrified of what a movement of people acting together for a better future can achieve. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Together we are taking power away from the political establishment and giving it back to everyday people.</b>

        <b>And we’re not going to stop anytime soon. </b>In fact, we’re already in full swing working to make sure Peter Dutton and Tony Abbott lose their seats at the next election, fighting to rid our politics of their toxic influence.   
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>And we will do it the way we always have — <i>together.</i></b>
