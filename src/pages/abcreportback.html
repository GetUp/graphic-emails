        The Morrison government has a dangerous opportunity to control the future of our ABC by handpicking it‚Äôs new Chair ‚Äì after the former Chairman was forced to resign over revelations he tried to fire journalists for reporting that angered the government.<sup>1</sup>

      <p>
        <b>Together, our incredible  movement sprang into action to expose Morrison‚Äôs sham selection process for the new ABC Chair to the public. </b> 6,195 GetUp members chipped in to fund our explosive Inside Job investigative report and custom minisite ‚Äì <i>which was viewed over 60,000 times.</i>

        We uncovered all the Coalition‚Äôs dirty tricks to install another of their cronies as the ABC‚Äôs Chair ‚Äì like asking a Liberal party donor and former Coalition MP to run the supposedly ‚Äòindependent‚Äô selection process.<sup>2</sup>

        <b class="orange">And we shone a light on Morrison‚Äôs prefered pick for the ABC chair role, former Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood,</b> showing the world how he gutted Fairfax newsrooms<sup>3</sup> and sold out the masthead‚Äôs editorial independence<sup>4</sup> ‚Äì while pocketing himself a $8.6million payout.<sup>5</sup>

        The report grabbed serious media attention ‚Äì dominating headlines and newsfeeds across the country. And it caught the public imagination, with our petition to defend our ABC‚Äôs independence reaching over 53,000 people in electorates right around the country.
