          We just had a watershed victory in the fight for compassion and justice for people seeking asylum in Australia. 
        <span class="orange bold">And it couldn’t have happened without you.</span>

      <p>
          Today, politicians of conscience from across the political spectrum passed a landmark bill ensuring sick men and women on Manus and Nauru are brought to Australia for treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
          This is the first time in 90 years a government has lost a vote on legislation in the lower house. <b>But more than that, it’s a story of how you helped end a 15-year political trajectory of greater and greater cruelty to refugees.</b>

          But let’s also take a look back at how you – along with thousands of GetUp members across the country – helped get all the kids and their families off Nauru. Together we pushed forward this legislation to deliver life-saving medical transfers to the people remaining offshore. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Firstly, GetUp members broke the Government’s blackout across Nauru by bringing the faces of the children imprisoned on Nauru (photos Peter Dutton didn’t want the public to see) into newspapers, onto giant billboards and in television ads across the country.
      </p>

      />
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>

      <p>
          This plea to simple humanity worked and when confronted with the faces of the little kids detained in our name, after 5 years of relentless detention, the media narrative started to shift.
      </p>

      />
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>

      <p>
          Then as the scale of the medical crisis offshore escalated, you funded hard hitting television commercials ensuring that the voices of doctors responsible for care, not the fear-mongering of Peter Dutton, defined the public debate. 
      </p>
      <img alt="Kids in Nauru" src="http://cdn.getup.org.au/image_19690_full.jpg" />
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <p>
          It worked! After years of deadlock, public opinion started to shift. GetUp members quickly polled the public in strategic places to provide support to politicians who wanted to do the right thing, but were nervous about community backlash. 
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <p>
          Then we turned our focus to every single politician in Canberra. GetUp members made phone calls, sent email messages and turned up to politicians offices to make the case for urgent action.
      </p>
      <img alt="GetUp members at the rally" src="http://cdn.getup.org.au/image_19694_full.jpg" />
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <p>
          We did not stop until politician after politician from across the political spectrum started to move. New voices began to speak out about how compassion and justice needed to prevail in our treatment of those who had spent 5 years offshore.  
      </p>
      <p>
          Then GetUp members sent a powerful message to the Liberal Party in the Wentworth by-election. It meant an utterly safe Liberal seat fell to independent Dr Kerryn Phelps, a strong advocate for the medical care of people seeking asylum.      </p>
      <p>
          As the Government faced a crescendo of public opinion, the faces of the children they had detained for 5 years, and doctors beamed into living rooms and parliamentary offices across the country, they buckled and announced that they’d have all kids off by Christmas.       </p>
      <img

      />
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <p>
          But GetUp members hadn’t fought this fight for so long, to only save children and ignore the 1000 adults still suffering offshore.
      </p>
      <p>
          <b>So GetUp members rallied outside MPs offices and Parliament House to back in a bill that would not only ensure children were off Nauru, but ill men and women offshore would be transferred to Australia for treatment.</b> Independent MP Dr Kerryn Phelps arrived in Parliament and put forward the bill in her name together with MPs Andrew Wilkie, Adam Bandt, Julia Banks, Cathy McGowan, and Rebekha Sharkie. 
      </p>
      <img alt="Collage" src="http://cdn.getup.org.au/image_19693_full.jpg" />
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <p>
          Then followed an intense two weeks as a crack team of GetUp staff took doctors, whistleblowers and legal specialists through the halls of Parliament knocking door after door to make the case to back the Bill as GetUp members were ringing on the phone lines and landing in MPs inboxes supporting the call. 
      </p>
      <p>
          On the final day of parliament in 2018, politicians from across the political spectrum – a coalition of conscience led by Independent Senator Tim Storer and Senator Nick McKim of the Greens (which included everyone from the ALP to Senator Derryn Hinch) – stood up for the Bill to end the medical crisis offshore. But filibustering by the Morrison Government and far right Senators Cory Bernardi and Pauline Hanson pushed the final House of Reps vote into this year.
      </p>
      <p>
          But of course, it wasn’t going to be easy to deliver a defeat to a sitting Government in the House of Representatives. Morrison and Dutton were unrelenting in their attacks. To stifle the obvious sympathy for children, they took the children out of detention, with no plan for the women and men who remained. They made a splash across the Murdoch Press alongside a campaign of fear. 
      </p>

      />
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <p>
          In the face of such overwhelming lies and fear-mongering, the ALP started to blink. Without their support, the Bill would have been dead in the water.
      </p>
      <p>
          But then you swung into action, elevating the voices of 6,480 doctors who signed an open letter backing the Bill  and beaming national TV ads into Parliament House. And you hit the phones and sent messages, and in just 1 day made 619 calls and sent 191 tweets urging politicians to stand strong.
      </p>

        alt="Graphic showing actions GetUp members took"

      />
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <p>
          It worked. The ALP stuck to the coalition of conscience, and negotiated frantically to clarify the Bill to address concerns without losing its original intention - to ensure ill people offshore were transferred to Australia for treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
          <b>So that brings us today, to a watershed victory in the House of Representatives which will change the way we treat people held offshore forever.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
          Never forget that you helped make this a reality. That every action you take to build something better does pay off, that while politics and people created our horrific offshore detention regime - we can also break it.
      </p>
      <p>
          We are writing this to you bleary eyed under the fluro lights of a nearly empty Parliament House, but our hearts are full thinking of you, and the people offshore you fought so bravely to see as human beings. They are cheering you tonight, and so are we.

            PS. The Senate needs to now pass this Bill - so keep by your phone, your email and get your boots ready for rallying - we’ve gotta seal the deal in the next few days.
