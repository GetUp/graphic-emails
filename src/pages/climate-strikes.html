        The feeling on the ground was <b><i>electric.</i></b> Standing in the middle of
        the action, it took <b><i>hours</i></b> for the chanting crowds to pass you by.

        <b class="blue">And the best way to secure that bright future?</b> Keep growing
        this incredible movement. Today’s strike more than doubled the numbers in March.
        Let’s make sure everyone knows what it feels like to stand for climate action in
        numbers too big to ignore.

        And sharing images, videos and stories of the strikes far and wide on social
        media, means that everyone — not just those who were able to make it — can
        experience the hope we shared in the streets today.
