          Inequality isn’t some clickbait concept for elites to laugh about in a lecture theatre. Inequality is over 2 million Australians struggling to put food on the table. It’s people across the country working longer hours for lower wages. Inequality is penalty rates being cut while executives award themselves record bonuses.

          <b class="black">This isn’t just a dangerous idea - it’s one that will cause real damage to those who can least afford it.</b>

          That’s why we’re bringing some of the stars of the Bernie Sanders campaign to Australia for <i>a once in a lifetime</i> masterclass on progressive policy, big organising and people powered change. <b>And you’re invited, {NAME|Friend}.</b>

<p>In 2016, people around the world were moved by the message of the Sanders campaign: <b class="black">when people we stand together and demand that our economy our country works for all of us, rather than the few, we can change the world.</b>
</p>

<p>It’s a message of hope that the public is hungry for. It’s an idea that has the potential to cut through the Murdoch spin, and correct the record on inequality. <b class="black">And ahead of the next federal election, it’ll be a rallying cry for dignity, compassion and economic inclusion opportunity for all – without exception.</b> </p>
